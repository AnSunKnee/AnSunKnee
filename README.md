- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with using GitHub, I'm kind of confused on how to turn in projects.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about my favorite show at the moment...I'll give you a hint it's the Big Bang Theory
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a single father of a beautiful 1 year old daughter named Mayari.
- âš¡ Fun Fact: I have Guatemalan roots, which goes back to the ancient Mayans. There are 16 dialects of the Mayan language, I know some words but I wish I was fluent.
